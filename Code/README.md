Using Machine Learning to predict solar output generated by solar tracker (Powered by Dark Sky)

Training the model based on GradientBoosting Regression explained in: 
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html

Summary

The project is split into three parts
preparer.py: Collects weather data from Dark Sky's API. Selects only specific columns and formats to fit the csv. Collects solar output data from past year's project results. Combines the two.
trainer.py: Fits the data into Regression model. 
predictor.py : Gets current weather forecast and predicts solar output
weather.py : Python module for reusable methods and variables
CompareTrainers.py: Compare the accuracy scores and plot the predicted values for different model
angle_calculator.py: Calculates the azimuth and zenith angle of the Sun
