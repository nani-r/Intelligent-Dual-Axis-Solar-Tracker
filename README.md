# Intelligent-Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker
The need for scalable, cost-effective alternative energy solutions is critical in ensuring a seamless transition into renewable power. Solar energy is one of the most widely used sources of alternative energy. Although new advancements have made solar panels more efficient and cost effective, they aren't used to their full potential. In order to increase the electricity generated by solar panels, we have designed a Dual-Axis solar tracker enabled by a gradient boosting machine learning model to reduce robot energy consumption and mathematical algorithms to accurately calculate the angle of the sun. As the
